Different perspectives offer various meanings:\n\n**Philosophical approaches:**\n- Creating your own purpose and meaning through choices and actions\n- Seeking happiness, fulfillment, or flourishing (eudaimonia)\n- Reducing suffering and increasing wellbeing for yourself and others\n- Pursuing truth, beauty, and understanding\n\n**Religious/spiritual views:**\n- Serving or connecting with a divine purpose\n- Spiritual growth and enlightenment\n- Preparing for an afterlife or next existence\n\n**Humanistic perspectives:**\n- Building meaningful relationships and connections\n- Contributing to something larger than yourself\n- Personal growth and self-actualization\n- Leaving a positive legacy\n\n**Existentialist view:**\n- Life has no inherent meaning, but this freedom allows you to create your own\n\nMany find meaning through combinations of these - perhaps in loving relationships, creative expression, helping others, pursuing knowledge, or working toward goals that matter to them.\n\nWhat aspects of this question resonate most with you? Sometimes exploring what gives *your* life a sense of purpose can be more valuable than seeking a universal answer.",
